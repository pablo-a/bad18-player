# bad18-player-page

This is an In-Progress PWA SPA Application made with Vue.js.  
It displays players from my badminton club and make search easy.  
At the moment it uses static data (scrapped beforehand and sent as a flat file), but i hope someday i'll find a way to get dynamic data from official database.
